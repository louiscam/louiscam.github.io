I currently serve as the [Bok Center](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/) Statistics Pedagogy Fellow at Harvard. My role includes training new Teaching Fellows and providing pedagogical support within the Statistics Department. Teaching is a unique way to communicate my passion for Statistics and pass on the skills and knowledge that I have received from my teachers. During my PhD, I worked as a Teaching Fellow in both graduate and undergraduate Statistics/Probability courses for which I received several [Teaching Awards](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/teaching-awards) from Harvard College.

I am also convinced that innovative teaching is key to promote Statistics and Probability among K-12 students. With the MIT [Global Teaching Labs](https://misti.mit.edu/your-resources/crafting-your-experience/types-programs/global-teaching-labs) in 2017, I taught probability to high school students in the [Jubilee Institute](http://www.jubilee.edu.jo/) (Amman, Jordan). My 4-week course used fun active learning strategies to introduce deep probability concepts with very little math. For example, students computed the proportion of land on Earth by randomly tossing an inflatable globe!

As an MSc researcher at MIT in 2016-2018, part of my [research](https://onlineinnovationsjournal.com/streams/editor-s-choice-articles/17558d930bc39ba2.html) focused on innovative teaching strategies using [MIT BLOSSOMS](https://blossoms.mit.edu/mit_blossoms_initiative_math_science_video_lessons_high_school_students), an
open-source and hands-on educational platform for high school STEM courses co-founded by my academic advisor [Professor Richard Larson](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/richard-larson/) (MIT IDSS). I shared in the [BLOSSOMS Newsletter](https://blossoms.mit.edu/news/newsletters/december_2016_january_2017) how BLOSSOMS proved to be an incredible resource to successfully engage students when I taught Probability at the Jubilee Institute.
