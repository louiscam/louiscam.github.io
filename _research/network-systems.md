Many social and biological network systems are characterized by highly sophisticated interactions and dynamics between agents. These networks often exhibit high sparsity, severe degree heterogeneity and mixed memberships. One task of great scientific interest is to identify the network's latent community structure. My research has focused on problems including global testing in static networks and mixed membership estimation in dynamic networks.

> In this work, I derived the phase transition of global detection (i.e., testing whether a network has more than one community) in the Mixed Membership Stochastic Block Model and I designed a novel statistically optimal and computationally tractable hypothesis test called the Power-Enhancement Test.
