I currently serve as the [Bok Center](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/) Pedagogy Fellow for Statistics at Harvard. My role includes training new Statistics Teaching Fellows and providing pedagogical support within the Statistics Department. I view teaching as a unique way to communicate my passion for Statistics to students and pass on the skills and knowledge that I have received from my teachers. During my PhD, I worked as Teaching Fellow in Statistics and Probability courses at both the graduate and the undergraduate level for which I was awarded with several Teaching Awards from Harvard College.

I am also convinced that impactful teaching is critical to promote Statistics and among K-12 students. As part of the MIT [MISTI Global Teaching Labs](https://misti.mit.edu/your-resources/crafting-your-experience/types-programs/global-teaching-labs), I taught an Introductory Probability course to high school students in the [Jubilee Institute](http://www.jubilee.edu.jo/) (Amman, Jordan) in January 2017. My 4-week curriculum used active learning strategies to teach the intuition behind deep scientific concepts (e.g. Monte Carlo sampling, network analysis) with almost no mathematical equations. This is possible, even in probability: for example, I had my students compute the proportion of land on Earth by randomly tossing an inflatable globe!

As an MSc researcher at MIT in 2016-2018, part of my research focused on innovative teaching strategies using [MIT BLOSSOMS](https://blossoms.mit.edu/mit_blossoms_initiative_math_science_video_lessons_high_school_students), an
open-source and hands-on educational platform for STEM courses at the high school level co-founded by my academic advisor [Professor Richard C. Larson](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/richard-larson/). BLOSSOMS proved to be an incredible tool teach Probability in a fun way and successfully engage students. I shared my experience in the [MIT BLOSSOMS Newsletter](https://blossoms.mit.edu/news/newsletters/december_2016_january_2017).
