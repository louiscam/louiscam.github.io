I currently serve as the [Bok Center](https://bokcenter.harvard.edu/) Statistics Pedagogy Fellow at Harvard. My role includes training new Teaching Fellows and providing pedagogical support within the Statistics Department. Teaching is a unique way to communicate my passion for Statistics and pass on the skills and knowledge that I have received from my teachers. During my PhD, I worked as a Teaching Fellow in Statistics/Probability courses at both the graduate and the undergraduate level, for which I received several Teaching Awards from Harvard College.

I am also convinced that impactful teaching is critical to promote Statistics among K-12 students. As part of the MIT [Global Teaching Labs](https://misti.mit.edu/your-resources/crafting-your-experience/types-programs/global-teaching-labs) in 2017, I taught an Introductory Probability course to high school students in the [Jubilee Institute](http://www.jubilee.edu.jo/) (Amman, Jordan). My 4-week curriculum used fun active learning strategies to teach the intuition behind deep probability concepts with almost no mathematical equations. For example, I had students compute the proportion of land on Earth by randomly tossing an inflatable globe!

As an MSc researcher at MIT in 2016-2018, part of my research focused on innovative teaching strategies using [MIT BLOSSOMS](https://blossoms.mit.edu/mit_blossoms_initiative_math_science_video_lessons_high_school_students), an
open-source and hands-on educational platform for STEM courses at the high school level co-founded by my academic advisor [Professor Richard C. Larson](https://idss.mit.edu/staff/richard-larson/). BLOSSOMS proved to be an incredible tool teach Probability in a fun way and successfully engage students. I shared my experience in the [MIT BLOSSOMS Newsletter](https://blossoms.mit.edu/news/newsletters/december_2016_january_2017).
