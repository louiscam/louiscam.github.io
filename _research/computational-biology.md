Modern breakthroughs in assays and computing have enabled the massive collection of data on complex biological systems. I develop computational biology methods to improve our understanding of gene regulation during health and disease and better inform *in vitro* scientific experiments. I have worked on projects including combinatorial biomarker identification, drug repurposing, gene regulation and sequential experimental design.

> In this project, I developed a drug repurposing pipeline using overparametrized representation learning, network analysis and causal structure learning and applied it to identify *in silico* candidate drug targets for the treatment of COVID-19. Our work got media coverage in the [MIT News Office](https://news.mit.edu/2021/machine-learning-treatment-covid-19-0216) and other specialized online media.
